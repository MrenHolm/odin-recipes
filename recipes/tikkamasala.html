    <ol>
        <p><li>Combine yoghurt, 2 teaspoons garam masala, paprika, black pepper, ½ teaspoon salt, cayenne pepper and ½ teaspoon coriander in a large bowl. Add chicken strips and toss to coat. Cover and marinate in refrigerator for 2 hours.</li></p>

        <p><li>Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir cumin seeds until lightly toasted and aromatic, about 3 minutes.

Cook and stir tomatoes, tomato paste and water into onion mixture until tomatoes begin to break down and incorporate into the onion mixture, about 10 minutes.</li></p>
